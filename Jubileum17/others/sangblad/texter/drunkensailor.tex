Early in the morning?\\

\repopen Hooray and up she rises \repclose\\
Early in the morning\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Put him in the longboat till he's sober..\\
Pull out the plug and wet him all over..\\
Give him a hair of the dog that bit him..\\
Put him in the scuppers with a hose-pipe on him..\\
Heave him by the leg in a runnin' bowline..\\
Shave his head with a rusty razor..\\
Put him in the bed with the captain's daughter..\\
That's what we do with a drunken sailor..\\
\end{vers}
